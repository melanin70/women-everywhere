<br>Here are some things that might be good to think about if you are a single mother:
<br>¨seek support¨
 It could be from ¨family, friends, a support group or a professional therapist.¨
<p></p>Take care of yourself. It is important that you feel well both physically and mentally, for both you and the child.

            <hr>
            <p>
                Baking allows kids to express their creativity through decorating cakes,cupcakes,cookies and other pastries. 
                They can experiment with different colors,shapes and designs and it gives them hands-on activity that engages all of the senses. 
                It is also an opportunity for bonding and social interaction.

            <hr>
            <p>A mommy and kid spa experience can be a wonderful way for mothers and children to bond, relax and pamper yourselves together. 
               It is also a screen free zone to encourage mindfulness and presence. 
               And of course we offer a 1 to 2 hour free time where the kids play together with supervision off our employees while mommy can either take a nap or continue relaxing in the spa.</p>
